# DoorCode
Door code interface with python and raspberryPi Controllers

This is a raspberry pi project that controls if a user entered the right/wrong access code. Depending on the outcome
of the entered code, a sound will buzz. There is an interface part where data can be listed in addition to the LCD Screen.
The data of every access attempt can also be stored in an SQL database. 


You will need :
Raspberry Pi or pico
Many cables (for + and GND)
Buzzer
Leds (ideally green and red)
LCD Screen
Keypad
breadboard 

The setup of the project is in the repo ( Montage 1-2-3 ) and in the "Rapport TP_Synthese"
